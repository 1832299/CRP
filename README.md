Complex reactions on particles - Examples from "Lagrangian simulation of mixing and reactions in complex geochemical systems"
By Engdahl, Benson, and Bolster (Water Resources Research, 2017, 53, doi:10.1002/2017WR020362.)

The files in this repository are designed to help users get their own particle-reaction codes up and running, but it is not intended to be a catch-all, standalone program for modeling reactive transport. 
The examples themselves are self-contained but users will first need to install the PhreeqcRM library which can be found at:
http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/

You are free to do whatever you like to these examples. We have extensively reviewed the results and verified them against known solutions. However, the authors claim no responsibility for the accuracy of the code and users assume all responsibility for testing/validating their own versions of the code.
